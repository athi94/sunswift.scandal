This is all support files for developing with a LPC1768 microcontroller.

LPC17xx.ld is the linker script for the LPC17xx series.
Linker script determines the physical placement of code in the address space
of the microcontroller.
This is currently set to program the LPC1768 with 512 kB Flash, 
32 kB local static RAM, 2x16 kB AHB ram (whatever it is)

startup_LPC17xx.s is the assembly startup file for LPC17xx.
This does things like setting up stacks, calling C libraries etc if needed before
jumping to C code.

LPC1700CMSIS is standard CMSIS from NXP. It's a bunch of #defines and
functions to access lpc1768 registers / hardware.

This folder is NOT modified at all from the standard CMSIS and should be 
able to directly replaced with later versions of CMSIS from NXP.

(except of some files calling "lpc17xx.h" instead of "LPC17xx.h" - 
linux is case sensitive.)

(and a lot of unused files are deleted, to keep size down 
everytime someone does a cvs co. Normally it's ~50 MB by itself)
